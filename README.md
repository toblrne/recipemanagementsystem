# My Personal Project

## Overview

I plan on creating a recipe management system where users can submit recipes (including images, list of steps, and
other text). Users will also be able to **vote** on recipes, add comments, and there will be a ranking system in place 
to display recipes (similar to Reddit). For instance, the recipe with the most votes will get be displayed at the top of
the page.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of recipe names
- As a user, I want to be able to add a recipe to a list of recipes
- As a user, I want to be able to choose a recipe and view it in more detail
- As a user, I want to be able to vote on recipes
- As a user, I want to be able to save my recipes to a file
- As a user, I want to be able to load my recipes from a file

## Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required event by typing into the "Enter Recipe Box" and "Enter Description Box", then 
- clicking the submit both button. This will show the recipe on the list

- You can generate the second required event by searching by recipe name in the search recipe box. This will load the
- the recipe data 

- You can locate my visual component by looking under the list box.
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the save button
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking the load button

## Phase 4, Task 2

This is an example of my event log after running the application and adding and searching some recipes

## Phase 4, Task 3

Reflection:

My UML Diagram turned out to be rather simple, which I think is a good thing. Overall, I don't think I would make any major
changes to the structure of my application. I could have separated the GUI into more components, as the file itself
was quite large. However, I don't think that this is of extreme importance.
